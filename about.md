# Working Experience:

## Celestia Tech Group
I had worked as a software development engineer in the aerospace sector for more than 4 years. Most of my professional experience lies in MATLAB coding and developing models to calculate the radiation patterns of different electronic scan antenna geometries for different phase beam designs. I evaluated massive amounts of radiation patterns looking for trade-offs based on aerospace regulations, client requirements, and engineering capabilities. In the words of the European Space Agency (ESA), “the project provided a high performance based on the state of the art of several key technologies [ESA Project](https://artes.esa.int/projects/escan).

From 2016 to Oct 2021

## Freelancer
I have experience in developing python code for algorithmic trading projects using Jupyter notebooks. My expertise includes utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Pytorch. I have experience in data aggregation from various API's such as FRED, Yahoo Finance, and Binance. I am also skilled in treating time series data and developing quantitative methods, supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models to predict next day price movements and create algorithmic trading robots for financial investment based on ML models
